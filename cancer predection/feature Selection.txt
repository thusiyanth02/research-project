1) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
2) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3) perimeter 
4) area 
5) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
6) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
7) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
8) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
9) symmetry 10) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" )


#####feature selection

Compactness_mean, concavity_mean and concave points_mean are correlated -> I choose concavity_mean.

radius_se, perimeter_se and area_se are correlated -> I choose area_se.

radius_worst, perimeter_worst and area_worst are correlated -> I choose area_worst.

Compactness_worst, concavity_worst and concave points_worst are correlated -> I choose concavity_worst.

Compactness_se, concavity_se and concave points_se are correlated -> I choose concavity_se.

texture_mean and texture_worst are correlated are correlated -> I choose texture_mean.

area_worst and area_mean are correlated -> I choose area_mean.
